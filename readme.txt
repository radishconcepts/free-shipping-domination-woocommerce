Disables all other shipping methods when the free shipping method is available (either through coupon or price requirement).

== Description ==

We use this plugin to always offer free shipping to the customers that are allowed to select it. Some customers might be allowed to select free shipping because of a coupon they got, while others might have hit the minimum order price for free shipping. In both cases, free shipping will automatically be selected and will be the only option available.
